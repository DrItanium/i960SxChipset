This project uses an ATmega1284p to act as a chipset for an i960SB-10 processor. The chipset runs in lockstep with the i960 and while slow does work wonderfully.
The project uses the MightyCore project from MCUDude. 

This project requires custom hardware that I have not released yet nor am I planning to do so in the near future. It also
uses a hand built AVR toolchain based off of GCC 11.2.0. Previously I was using 7.1.0 but I wanted to take advantage of C++20 in the future.
I am currently in testing on this.
